Submitted by: Sviatlana Lyskova

Time spent: ~30 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [X] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [X] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [X] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [X] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Add "Delete task" button (it's hidden while adding a new task)
* [ ] Add "Delete all" feature with appropriate dialog
* [ ] Add "Unsaved changes" dialog while pressing Up/Back buttons 
* [ ] Add appropriate error message in case required "Name" field is empty
* [ ] Add "Empty screen"
